            <h4><strong>The Service</strong></h4>
            <p id="smalltext3">The Church is large enough for the District Scouts. Parents/carers may follow the
                Parade to the Church and a few may be able to sit/stand inside for the Service, which should
                last approximately 45 minutes between 11.15am and 12noon. The programme is available
                <a id="church_link", href="church_service.pdf">here</a>, but
                will also be visible on screens within the Church. If you feel a paper copy
                is required, please print it off yourself.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-12 text-grid">
            <h4><strong>Flag Bearers</strong></h4>
            <p id="smalltext">Once all groups are located in the Church, the flag bearers will be asked to enter the tower room. During the first
                hymn, they will walk up the aisle, present their flags to the Vicar and sit in the choir pews.
                At the end of the service, they will collect their flags, line the aisle, then let them dip during the National
                Anthem, before entering the tower room again where the flags are to be left.
                Leaders are responsible for collecting their Flags after the Service from the tower room.

            <h4><strong>Other Information</strong></h4>
            <p id="smalltext2">Leaders should sit with their Sections.
                During the National Anthem, all members should stand at 'alert', if possible.
                In the event of emergency, please follow your Section Leaders as directed.
                Groups are responsible for handing over their young people to their Parents/Carers after the Service.<br><br>
                As a public event, members of the public will be able to take photos and videos of the Parade. It is also expected
                that members of the press and media will be in attendance and that the Parade will be featured in the Eastern
                Daily Press, North Norfolk News and other local media, publications and websites. Section leaders should be
                aware of any children who should not be photographed for any reason and inform the parents that photography
                cannot necessarily be controlled at this event.
