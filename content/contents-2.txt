            <h4><strong>Providing sustainable power to the world</strong></h4>
            <p>One of the main factors contributing to climate change is greenhouse gases
                released from burning fossil fuels. Thus, one of the core aims of the goal
                is to substantially increase the proportion of the global energy mix that
                comes from renewable sources.</p>

            <h4><strong>But it's more than just renewable energy</strong></h4>
            <p>Many people across the globe still use polluting fuels for their cooking,
                resulting both in the release of greenhouse gases and food that is less healthy.
                According to WHO, electrical stoves are much safer for use, due to the
                production of harmful gases from cooking with natural gas.</p>

            <p>Providing this basic commodity for countries that do not have enough, such as 
                the least developed countries and developing island nations, will provide vital 
                jobs for their economy and assist in their part on the global stage.<br><br></p>
